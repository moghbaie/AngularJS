The Thomas B. Jeffery Company produced the Jeffery automobile in 1900.  Nash Motors Company bought Jeffery in 1917. Nash later dropped the Jeffery brand. In 1937, Nash and Kelvinator merged with each other. In 1950, the first Nash Rambler was designed as a compact two-door sedan. The motivation for producing the Rambler was the post World War II economy and the Korean War’s steel quota policy. Similar to other automakers’ strategies under pressure from the Big Three, Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson Motor Car Company merged in 1954. The new American Motors Corporation (AMC) discontinued the Nash Rambler in 1955. In 1958, AMC reintroduced the Nash Rambler and renamed it Rambler American. After reentering the compact car market, the Rambler American as an American compact-car helped AMC into the black for the first time since the merger of the Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson (NYT, Jul. 25, 1958c). Rambler built strong market perceptions of high quality, lower gas consumption and, in general, a high-value economy car. After 1960, the Big Three entered the compact car market. President George W. Romney led Rambler towards diversification by sharing production lines, chasses, and parts to broaden market offerings. AMC decided to broaden its market offerings and entered the standard and full-size automobile market. In 1963 George Romney left AMC to become Michigan governor. Roy Abernethy took the helm and switched strategy to compete against the Big Three head to head (NYT, Jul. 25, 1965a). In 1967, Roy D. Chapin replaced Roy Abernethy. By 1968, Rambler only had the Rambler American in the market. After that, Mr. Chapin began to broaden AMC’s compact car offerings (NYT, May 6, 1969a). For competing with Ford’s Maverick, AMC produced a new compact model, Hornet. For competing against imported cars and expecting create a new niche market, AMC created other sub-compact car, Gremlin (NYT, Feb. 13, 1970). The Hornet replaced Rambler in 1969 even though it still had reasonable sales volumes (NYT, Aug. 14, 1969b; NYT, Mar. 10, 1987).
